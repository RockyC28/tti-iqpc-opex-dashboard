# Automated Production Dashboards for IQPC and OPEX

## 1. Project Overview
In this project, I developed automated data ingestion tools and data visualization dashboards related to the IQPC (In-Quality Process Control) and OPEX (Operational Excellence) initiatives at Techtronic Industries (TTI) to monitor production and quality performance.
The aim was to turn reports from Excel spreadsheets, produced manually every day, into an automated, near real-time line performance snapshot that can be accessed daily by management and engineers.

**Key outcomes:**
- Automated data refresh and calculations, reducing manual reporting tasks.
- Allowed the production and quality managers to review important data regarding line, product, and shift performance in one centralized place.
- Improved visibility into defect trends and bottlenecks, supporting faster root-cause analysis and decision-making.

## 2. My Role and Skills Demonstrated
I worked as a **Data Analyst Intern** on the Business Systems Team and was mainly responsible for:

- **Data work**: Data from SQL Server and Excel logs was extracted and combined; product, line, and time variables harmonized.
- **Modeling/Analysis**: Key metrics like defect rate, rework rate, output per line, and First Pass Yield have been identified and calculated.
- **Visualization/product**: Developed data visualization dashboards using Power BI tools in the IQPC and OPEX cases, using drill-down filters and KPI visualization.
- **Collaboration**: Worked with the engineering, QA, and management teams to understand requirements and refine dashboard designs.




This project highlights my skills in:
- Python (pandas) for data cleaning and transformation process
- SQL queries, joins, and aggregation operations related to data from both "Production" and “Quality” databases
- Power BI for data modeling, DAX Formulas, and dashboarding Practices     
- Cross-functional communication and documentation of metrics and workflows

## 3. Data and Methods
**Data sources:**
- Production line logs from SQL Server (output, cycle time, downtime)
- Quality inspection records from internal systems (defects, rework, scrap)
- Reference tables for products, lines, shifts, and dates

**Main steps:**
1. **Data extraction**  
   - Wrote SQL queries to pull daily production and defect data from multiple tables and exports.
2. **Cleaning & transformation**  
   - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and aligned timestamps; created shift, day, and product-level aggregates.
3. **Analysis / metrics**  
   - Calculated defect rates, rework rates, throughput, and other IQPC/OPEX KPIs at different levels (line, product, shift, day).
4. **Dashboard / product**  
   - Built interactive Power BI pages that allow users to filter by date range, line, product family, and defect type, with KPI cards, trend charts, and detailed tables.

## 4. Results and Impact
Some key results from the project:

- Managers can easily identify where defects exist in terms of product, line, and time of day without having to link spreadsheets.
- The dashboards aid in pointing out which lines or stations have unusual trending patterns.
- Weekly and monthly reports can be generated directly from the dashboards, greatly reducing the time spent on manual reporting.

These results show how data engineering and visualization can directly support factory operations, quality improvement, and decision-making.

## 5. How This Connects to My Career
This project means a lot in terms of my career because it illustrates that I can:

- Working with real industry data and extracting it to build an analytical tool.
- Communicate technical results in a way that non-technical stakeholders can understand and act on.
- Work with the business and technical teams to determine the metrics and build tools that get used. 

I would like to continue growing in the role of **Business/Data Analyst**, focusing on projects where data can help solve real-world issues in business, including operations, supply chains, and process optimization.
